# Time in time out

This is a Markdown dairy created in order to document the process of creation of the project for the cours "Atelier labo" of the school HEAD - Genève (Master Media Design). 

[Official brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nvp34unVpncj-lEndjVZmtstaFPLerHOILGym4uCIaA/edit)

## Objectives 

In this atelier, we will create playable stories for our wrists using time as our starting point. We will go about it in four-parts:

* First part<br />
we will observe how we relate to time in our daily lives. Looking at Time as an object, we will study how we can use this personal data to tell stories. More broadly, we will also study various important time concepts as well as various time devices throughout history and culture. 

* Second part<br />
we will study game mechanics, interactive narrations and alternative controllers to expand our definition of what is an interaction and its relation to our body. From these lessons, we will use what we’ve learned and our daily observations to create scenarios and early concepts.

* Third part<br />
will focus on the iterative and prototyping process, using simple materials such as cardboard and paper, we will prototype our first concepts and ideas. These first ideas will be then tested with MD2 students and guests. 

* Fourth part <br />
will be the final prototyping stage and will be articulated with the Electronics Laboratory. We will learn how to translate an interactive concept into technical plans, circuits and 3D models. We will discover various production possibilities and make our final playable story!
 <br />
 
The result will be a collection of playful stories to wear and play around the wrist.



## Pitches

We will be exploring constantly writing and re-writing pitches. There is a [pitches](https://github.com/michelle-po/head-md-time-in-time-out/tree/main/pitches) folder for all the pitches.

## Process
In [process](https://github.com/michelle-po/head-md-time-in-time-out/tree/main/process) will be stocked all the researches and observation done. Another object folder is there with all the researches linked to the final prototype 


## Prototype
In this folder will appear all files and sketches linked to the final objects, the final [prototype](https://github.com/michelle-po/head-md-time-in-time-out/tree/main/prototype)
