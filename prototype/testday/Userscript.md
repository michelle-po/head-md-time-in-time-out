# 0-800-STRESS-LINE

*"Feeling anxious, nervous, or stressed? Call the STRESS-LINE! We will fill your heart with positivity and make you forget problems: life is good, don't waste it being sad."*

On your wearable, you will receive calls from people struggling with disparate stressing situations. Quickly you will have to decide how to help them as best you can while avoiding toxic positivity.

Be careful: each choice you make may reveal people's identities and needs, but potentially change the final of the call too. Will you be able to give them the right advice before time runs out?
