# TEST PROTOCOL 21.12.22

## Description
To understand if the previously thinked interactions with the prototype are clear and easy to understand, is necessary to test the reaction of the user to the question and the remaining time to answer them. 


## Methodology
To test differents possible scenarios of interactions, the best test methodology to use is A/B testing. Thanks to that, is easier to understand which option is more intuitive and simple.

The subjects will be separated in 2 groups: </br>
A) Going through the narration with a timing to remember to the user the time passing, and see clearly how many seconds are left to complete the experience. This will show the stress effect on decision capability</br>
B) Going through the narration normally, but the time left is proportional on the volume of the narration: all time available --> high volume, 0--> zero volume. 


## Sampling
* Time: 10 minutes
* Date: 21.12.22, HEAD - GenÃ¨ve
* Tools: timer, story script
* Subject: HEAD's student by groups, MMD1 & MMD2 classes

## Results
* sometimes for user it was difficult to understand the role they were playing (sombody needing help/givin help)
--> it's essential to be clear on the first phrase, the approach of the interaction, to understand that we are helping people on the phone with our answers. Whitout context is not efficiant. </br>

* be careful on how question are asked, the sintax can change the answer and the specifical word used by the user on the phone. If's not the right maybe it won't work. </br>
--> have THE trigger world + 1 option?</br>

* The B version (volume timing) doesn't work, this was not understanded! It was interpreted as a fault of the connection on the phone or a mistake on the prototype</br>
--> version A was better received, users told that seeing the time runs out caused a feeling of stress on them. </br>


* More than one people take some time to understand that they needed to asnwer only with one word. They were trying to confort the person on the phone using phrases. </br>
--> The solution was repeating the question until there was a triggering aswer by the user.
