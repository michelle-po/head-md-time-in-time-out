# TEST PROTOCOL 21.12.22

## Description
To understand if the previously thinked interactions with the prototype are clear and easy to understand, is necessary to test the reaction of the user to the question and the remaining time to answer them. 


## Methodology
To test differents possible scenarios of interactions, the best test methodology to use is A/B testing. Thanks to that, is easier to understand which option is more intuitive and simple.

The subjects will be separated in 2 groups: </br>
A) Going through the narration with a timing to remember to the user the time passing, and see clearly how many seconds are left to complete the experience. This will show the stress effect on decision capability</br>
B) Going through the narration normally, but the time left is proportional on the volume of the narration: all time available --> high volume, 0--> zero volume.
