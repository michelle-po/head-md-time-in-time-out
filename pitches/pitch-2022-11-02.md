# Everybody's stressed

I conducted two analyses this week:
* an anonymous online form with questions on the relationship between personal feelings and the passing of time.
* I ask to people to draw their own emotions felt at 3 times of the day and their causes.

These observations led me to imagine a world in which emotions are used as skins or wearable objects, where they can give the protagonist skills in order to deal with day commitments and their duration.
