# Â¿Que horas son mi corazon?


After photographing the input of commitments and asking people how they used to organise their days, this project will relate two people through their daily commitments:

Every person in the world has a different view of time passing and occupies his or her days as best he or she believes / can with respect to the commitments that society imposes on them. These commitments can take a toll on personal's anxiety, but on a human level we often cannot understand why a person is stressed when it is a quiet day for us.

This wearable will allow relate two people through their daily commitments and better understand all the time commitments that can affect their mental health.
